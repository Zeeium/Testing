            <p>For over fifteen years, I have helped individuals and families to grow into who they need to be for themselves and for the people who are most important to them. I aim to help my clients improve themselves, manage challenging circumstances, deepen their relationships, and feel up to the many important tasks and roles that they encounter. I see my patients as having tremendous inner resources and also difficulties using those capabilities, or learning new ones. My practice helps people strengthen what they already know, resolve problems, and move through challenging life experiences. My style is pragmatic, direct, and active. To me, a therapist is an ally who rolls up her sleeves to understand and contribute positively to people's lives.</p>

                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>I received my Masters in Social Work in 2005 from New York University. My career began in New York City in 2001, working in a range of healthcare, mental health, and social welfare settings. I obtained a PhD from Duke University in History, studying, teaching, and researching public health policy, social welfare history, and maternal and infant health. I have completed postgraduate training in psychoanalytic psychotherapy with the Westchester Center for Study of Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy, and in Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) with Behavioral Tech. I have also trained extensively in divorce mediation, parenting coordination, and collaborative divorce with the Center for Mediation and Training, The Cooperative Parenting Institute, and the New York Association for Collaborative Professionals. I am a member of numerous New York-based professional organizations dedicated to helping families have non-litigated divorces that are easier on them and their children. I have trained as a Rape Crisis Counselor and have served as a volunteer victims' services advocate with Westchester Medical Center’s SAAVE Program (Sexual Assault, Abuse, and Victim’s Empowerment Program).</p>

                    <h3>Therapy for Adults</h3>
                    <p>Adults come to therapy to come up for air when they feel flooded by their emotions or to find new ways to deal with anxiety, trauma, or loss. I work with people to locate and address consistent trends in their lives and relationships that lead to pain, frustration, or conflict. People with depression and bipolar disorder use therapy with me to become more able to regulate their mood and work through triggers. I aim to help people find greater meaning in their lives, and feel more connected to themselves and others.</p>

                    <h3>Couples Therapy</h3>
                    <p>I help couples understand why they are having trouble talking about difficulties in their relationship, and work with them to reopen lines of communication. Couples learn to initiate conversations about sensitive topics that have worsened with silence and discover crucial differences in their perspectives about shared experiences. Individuals in couples therapy become less reactive toward their partner and more willing to hold themselves accountable. My goal is for couples to heal from conflict and loss, and to grow in empathy toward one another.</p>

                    <h3>Therapy for Teenagers</h3>
                    <p>My first step in treating teenagers is to learn about how they see their lives – their friends, parents, and obligations. I help teenagers feel heard and supported while I work with them to identify methods to improve relationships and become more accountable for their choices. I help parents respond to serious concerns such as school avoidance, eating disorders, sibling conflict, acting out, anxiety, and mood difficulties. When needed, I collaborate closely with psychiatrists, school counselors, pediatricians, and other practitioners to ensure appropriate management of all issues.</p>

                    <h3>Consultation & Assessment</h3>
                    <p>When people come to me for a consultation, I conduct an extensive, detailed, and intuitive evaluation. I provide a diagnostic assessment including clinical impressions and relevant psychosocial context. My goal is for people to leave my office with an understanding of how their presenting problems may relate to underlying mental health difficulties, personal history, or circumstantial stressors. I make recommendations for how clinical treatment may be helpful, provide feedback on how difficulties may be managed by families on their own, and--when needed--make referrals to other specialists.</p>
